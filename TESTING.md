# Testing

## Test policy

Tests protect reproducibility and prevent false-positive drift.

## Unit tests

Unit tests cover small deterministic functions and placeholder status in Stage 0A.

## Integration tests

Integration tests will later cover manifest execution and result writing.

## Golden tests

Golden tests will later reproduce known solved-page behavior from locked fixtures. None are included in Stage 0A.

Stage 0B adds conditional real-workbook tests that run only when the ignored legacy workbook is locally present.

## Property tests

Property tests will later check transform invariants, inverse behavior, and edge cases.

Synthetic workbook parser tests cover inventory, solved-delta extraction, modulo validation, Prime Sums booleans, formula inventory, deterministic output, and CLI behavior.

## Fuzz tests

Fuzz tests will later target parsers, manifest loading, corpus normalization, and transform composition.

## CPU/GPU parity tests

Every CUDA kernel must match a CPU reference implementation across representative inputs and edge cases.

## Manifest determinism tests

Manifests must replay to the same outputs under pinned inputs and fixed seeds.

## Documentation consistency tests

Documentation checks should verify core policy statements such as raw-data immutability and Stage 0A restrictions.

Legacy workbook tests include p56 prime-minus-one first-delta checks, Welcome `DIVINITY` delta checks, and direct-page zero-delta checks for solved fixture hints.

Legacy Pastebin tests include first-pair prime validation, empty-pair preservation, Parable anchor detection, page-boundary non-finalization, and local-real-file conditional tests.

Stage 0D tests cover rtkd parser preservation, scream314 reference parsing, signature indexing, Pastebin-to-transcript alignment, tentative page-boundary candidates, glyph variant `ᛂ`, CLI commands, and real-source conditional smoke checks.

## Stage 0A smoke tests

Stage 0A includes C++ and Python smoke tests only.

## Stage 0B workbook tests

Stage 0B parser tests are Python-only. CUDA and C++ behavior are unchanged.

## Stage 0C Pastebin tests

Stage 0C parser tests are Python-only. They verify that prime values are converted to decimal indices and that generated records remain non-canonical.

## Stage 0D alignment tests

Stage 0D parser and alignment tests are Python-only. They assert no canonical boundary activation, no canonical trust flag, raw glyph preservation, and timing metadata presence.

## Stage 0D-P documentation and GitHub checks

Stage 0D-P validates tutorial, issue seed, wiki source, and GitHub script existence. GitHub helper scripts support dry runs before mutating labels, issues, or wiki pages.
