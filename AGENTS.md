## Mission

Maintain a reproducible, conservative research workbench for future Liber Primus GPU cryptanalysis.

## Non-negotiable facts

- Do not invent solved pages.
- Do not claim a solve without a reproducible manifest and matching output.
- Do not overwrite raw data.
- Do not silently change rune mappings or transcript rules.
- Do not optimise CUDA before CPU/GPU parity tests pass.
- Every transform must have a CPU reference implementation before a CUDA implementation.
- Every CUDA kernel must have parity tests and a benchmark.
- `data/raw/` is immutable.
- No generated experiment outputs should be committed.
- Do not use `git add .` or `git add --all`.
- Stage only explicit files.
- Terminal output alone is never evidence of a solve.

## Current stage

Stage 0A is project bootstrap only. The repository contains structure, documentation, toolchain scripts, smoke tests, and placeholders.

## Source-of-truth files

Use `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATASET.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, `CUDA_NOTES.md`, `RESULTS_SCHEMA.md`, and `STATUS.md` as persistent context.

## Corpus immutability rules

Raw source material belongs under `data/raw/` only when explicitly allowed by a later stage. Never normalize, patch, crop, OCR, transcribe, or deduplicate raw files in place.

## Coding standards

Prefer small, explicit modules with clear provenance boundaries. Avoid clever transformations without tests and documentation.

## C++ standards

Use C++20, namespace all project code under `libreprimus`, and keep Stage 0A code dependency-free.

## CUDA standards

CUDA is optional. Add CUDA only behind `LPGPU_ENABLE_CUDA`. Never add a kernel without CPU reference behavior, parity tests, and a benchmark plan.

## Python standards

Use Python >=3.12,<3.14. Keep Python orchestration code typed, testable, and independent of compiled bindings until a later stage.

## Testing standards

Smoke tests prove the scaffold. Future transform tests must include known inputs, negative controls, determinism checks, and parity tests.

## Documentation standards

Document policy before implementation. Record assumptions, evidence levels, manifest requirements, and stop conditions near the code they govern.

## How to add a future cipher module

Create a CPU reference transform first, document the hypothesis in `CIPHER_CATALOG.md`, add unit tests, add manifest examples, and only then consider acceleration.

## How to add a future CUDA kernel

Start from the CPU reference and write parity tests before optimization. Add a benchmark that records hardware, compiler, CUDA version, and dataset lock.

## How to add a future experiment

Add a YAML manifest under `experiments/manifests/` with corpus locks, transform chain, scorer configuration, null controls, output policy, and review steps.

## How to record results

Write generated results to ignored result locations. Preserve manifest ID, git commit, corpus locks, transform chain, score breakdown, hardware metadata, and reviewer notes.

## False-positive controls

Every plausible result must be compared with null controls, shuffled controls where appropriate, score baselines, and manual review criteria.

## Citation/source rules

Do not treat memory, screenshots, or terminal output as source evidence. Later corpus work must cite source URL, acquisition date, hash, license status, and transcript policy.

## Git/staging rules

Preserve remotes and branches. Do not stage build outputs, caches, virtual environments, generated result files, raw corpus data, downloaded installers, logs, or databases.

## Prohibited actions

Do not download real corpus data in Stage 0A. Do not run brute force, long benchmarks, CUDA stress tests, or unbounded searches. Do not print secrets or credential-bearing environment variables.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report if a tool install requires reboot, a CUDA installer requires driver replacement, raw data would be modified, or the repository has conflicting tracked user changes.
